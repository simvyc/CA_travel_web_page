## CA_travel_web_page
#Travel Web Page Developed using Bootstrap
<br />
<br />
This is my first front end project for Code Academy Python class. 
<br />
The main idea of the page is to allow the user buy a travel. There is some offers, for example Estonia, Norway... If the user wants to go to Estonia, he fills the contact us form and then travel agent contacts him about details.
